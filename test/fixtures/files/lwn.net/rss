      <title>Kuhn: A Comprehensive Analysis of the GPL Issues With the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Business Model</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/936127/</link>

      <description>
      Over on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfconservancy.org/&quot;&gt;Software Freedom Conservancy&lt;/a&gt; blog, Policy Fellow and Hacker-in-Residence Bradley M. Kuhn &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2023/jun/23/rhel-gpl-analysis/&quot;&gt;analyzes&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/935592/&quot;&gt;recent changes to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) source availability&lt;/a&gt; in light of the GPL.  It contains some interesting information about two alleged GPL violations that came about because the company's business model is structured in a way that brings it too close to non-compliance with the license, he said:
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
Perhaps the biggest problem with a murky business model that skirts the line of GPL compliance is that violations can and do happen — since even a minor deviation from the business model clearly violates the GPL agreements. Pre-IBM Red Hat deserves a certain amount of credit, as SFC is aware of only two documented incidents of GPL violations that have occurred since 2006 regarding the RHEL business model. We've decided to share some general details of these violations for the purpose of explaining where this business model can so easily cross the line.
&lt;p&gt;
[...] In another violation incident, we learned that Red Hat, in a specific non-USA country, was requiring that any customer who lowered the number of RHEL machines under service contract with Red Hat sign an additional agreement. This additional agreement promised that the customer had deleted every copy of RHEL in their entire organization other than the copies of RHEL that were currently contracted for service with Red Hat. Again, this is a &quot;further restriction&quot;. The GPL agreements give everyone the unfettered right to make and keep as many copies of the software as they like, and a distributor of GPL'd software may not require a user to attest that they've deleted these legitimate, licensed copies of third-party-licensed software under the GPL. SFC informed Red Hat's legal department of this violation, and we were assured that this additional agreement would no longer be presented to any Red Hat customers in the future.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      The final day of the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023&quot;&gt;2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit&lt;/a&gt; featured three separate sessions led by
Luis Chamberlain (he also led a &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/933437/&quot;&gt;plenary&lt;/a&gt; on
day two); the first of those was a filesystem session on the status of the
kthread-freezer-removal effort.  The kthread freezer is meant to help
filesystems freeze their state in order to
suspend or hibernate the system, but since at least&amp;nbsp;2015, the &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/662703/&quot;&gt;freezer has been targeted for removal&lt;/a&gt;.  Things
&lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/705269/&quot;&gt;did not change much&lt;/a&gt; a year later, nor &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/752588/&quot;&gt;by 
LSFMM in&amp;nbsp;2018&lt;/a&gt; when Chamberlain had picked up Jiri Kosina's removal
effort; this year, Chamberlain was back to try to push things along.

      The AlmaLinux organization has posted &lt;a
href=&quot;https://almalinux.org/blog/impact-of-rhel-changes/&quot;&gt;a message&lt;/a&gt;
describing the impact of Red Hat's decision to stop releasing the source to
the RHEL distribution and how AlmaLinux will respond.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
	In the immediate term, our plan is to pull from CentOS Stream
	updates and Oracle Linux updates to ensure security patches
	continue to be released. These updates will be carefully curated to
	ensure they are 1:1 compatible with RHEL, while not violating Red
	Hat’s licensing, and will be vetted and tested just like all of our
	other releases.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: Rocky Linux has also &lt;a
href=&quot;https://rockylinux.org/news/2023-06-22-press-release/&quot;&gt;sent out a
release&lt;/a&gt; on the subject.  &quot;&lt;q&gt;There will be no disruption or change for
any Rocky Linux users, collaborators, or partners&lt;/q&gt;&quot;.

      <description>
      The quest to enable limited use of BPF features in unprivileged processes
continues.  In &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/929746/&quot;&gt;the previous episode&lt;/a&gt;, an
attempt to use authoritative Linux security module (LSM) hooks for this
purpose was strongly rejected by the LSM developers.  BPF developer Andrii
Nakryiko has now returned with a new mechanism based on a
privilege-conveying token.  That approach, too, has run into some
resistance, but a solution for the strongest concerns might be in sight.

      <title>[$] Merging copy offload</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/935260/</link>

      <description>
      Kernel support for copy offload is a feature that has been floating around
in limbo for a decade or more at this point; it has been implemented along 
the way, but never merged.  The idea is that the host
system can simply ask a block storage device to copy some data within the device
and it 
will do so without further involving the host; instead of reading data into
the host so that it can be written back out again, the device circumvents
that process.  At the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023&quot;&gt;2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit&lt;/a&gt;, Nitesh Shetty led a storage and
filesystem session to discuss the current status of a patch set that he and
others have been working on, with an
eye toward getting something merged fairly soon.

      Red Hat has &lt;a

that public source releases will be restricted to CentOS Stream going
forward:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
	As the CentOS Stream community grows and the enterprise software
	world tackles new dynamics, we want to sharpen our focus on CentOS
	Stream as the backbone of enterprise Linux innovation. We are
	continuing our investment in and increasing our commitment to
	CentOS Stream. &lt;b&gt;CentOS Stream will now be the sole repository for
	public RHEL-related source code releases&lt;/b&gt;. For Red Hat customers
	and partners, source code will remain available via the Red Hat
	Customer Portal.

      <description>
      Running a Linux distribution on Arm-based single-board computers (SBCs)
is still not as easy as on x86 systems because many Arm devices require a
vendor-supplied kernel, a patched bootloader, and other device-specific
components. One distribution that addresses this problem is &lt;a
href=&quot;https://www.armbian.com&quot;&gt;Armbian&lt;/a&gt;, which offers Debian- and
Ubuntu-based distributions for
many devices. The headline feature in the recent release, &lt;a
href=&quot;https://www.armbian.com/newsflash/armbian-23-05-suni/&quot;&gt;Armbian
23.05&lt;/a&gt;, which came at the end of May, is a major rework of the build
framework that has been made faster and more reliable after three years of
development.

      <description>
      Backporting fixes to stable kernels is an ongoing process that, in general,
is handled by the stable maintainers or the developers of the fixes.
However, due 
to some unhappiness in the XFS development
community with the process of handling stable fixes for that filesystem,
a different process has come about for backporting XFS patches to the
stable kernels.  The three developers doing that work, Leah Rumancik, Amir
Goldstein, and Chandan Babu Rajendra, led a plenary session at the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023&quot;&gt;2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit&lt;/a&gt;  (with Rajendra
participating remotely)  to discuss that process.

the formation of the Rust Leadership Council, which will take the place of
the existing Core Team and Leadership Chat groups.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
	The Council will assume responsibility for top-level governance
	concerns while most of the responsibilities of the Rust Project
	(such as maintenance of the compiler and core tooling, evolution of
	the language and standard libraries, administration of
	infrastructure, etc.) remain with the nine top level teams.
